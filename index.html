     <h3> Defeêœ¾ted by Sofia Mejia

 <p>    


Inspired by the glitch art aesthetic, I wanted to create pieces that emulated some kind of error or glitch. I also wanted to incorporate both an interactive component and a generative art component.   I created a tile grid that changes sizes and colors based on the x and y mouse position.


I also  took inspiration from Roni Kaufmanm, a generative art javascript/p5js artist. He creates intricate generative compositions. Using a base code provided by Kaufmanm, I created a composition made of rectangles, circles, and triangles, using vivid colors. This composition, which is placed on top of the tile grid, changes colors and the shapes change positions every time the code runs again. As a result, the colors that start out in the tile grid also change every time the code runs again. The generative art on top, changes the look of the tile grid below.
